# Simple-Traingle-Game

This is minimalist game that I developed for the class Advanced Game Design & Development in the University of Reykjavik. 

This is a shooter where you have to defeat the crow boss.

With left click you jump and right click you dash. You will dash depending on the position of the mouse. 

With middle click you can perform a power recoil shoot that will inflict more damage and you can use it as a propellant. (After this shoot, you will not be able to shoot for 3 seconds).

The normal shooting is automatic.

So perform combos with the dash and the recoil shoot and dodge the enemy attacks.

The game will stop either if you win or lose.

Both the boss and the player were developed with state machines.
